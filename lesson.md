# Introduction to Github, Git, and Rmarkdown

We will be using GitHub Classroom to distribute and submit assignments.  You accept assignments that create GitHub repositories ("repos") in your class GitHub organization (something like https://github.com/frec-3044-spring25).  Your repositories are private, so only you and the instructor can see them.  You will be expected to make numerous commits to your repo for each assignment, including the final commit that will be graded.  This assignment walks you through the steps required to start and complete the other assignments in the course.

## Context

This module has been developed as the second module in a junior-level Environmental Data Science course at Virginia Tech.  The course is required for majors in the Environmental Data Science degree.  The course has a pre-requisite course that introduces students to tidyverse concepts.  This module is designed to get students set up with workflows involving Git, GitHub, and Rmarkdown rendering that are required for all future assignments.

## Timeframe

1 75-minute class period is allocated to this module at the beginning of the course.

## Background Reading

Jennifer Bryan has created an excellent user guide for working with Git and GitHub within Rstudio.  It can be found [here](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html)
